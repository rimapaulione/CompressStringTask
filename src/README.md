# Java Sourcery Academy bonus task 2025 Spring

A simple Java program that compresses a given string by counting consecutive repeated characters.

## How it works

The program scans the input string and replaces consecutive duplicate characters with the character followed by its count.
If the input is empty or contains only spaces, it returns an empty string.

### Task
In your own words, describe the key parts of your solution and the reasoning behind your approach. You can use comments in your code to explain your thought process.

### Input
The input string will contain only lowercase letters. It might be empty.Output :
"aaabb" → "a3b2"
"abc" → "a1b1c1"
"" → ""
